# Welcome ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Juan!

I'm a well-established software engineering leader with passion for programming, leadership and small details.

Throughout my career, I have made it my priority to combine academic and professional skills. Thatâ€™s why I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering at Harvard University Extension School. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work for large scale enterprises in different industries, spanning Frontend, Backend, DevOps, and Leadership roles.

I'm currently working at Energicos GmbH, where I lead a team of 6 engineers and have fun building a product for reducing the carbon footprint
