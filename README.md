# Welcome 👋

My name is Juan!

I'm a well-established software engineering leader with passion for programming, leadership and small details.

Throughout my career, I have made it my priority to combine academic and professional skills. That’s why I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Harvard University Extension School. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work for large scale enterprises in different industries, spanning Frontend, Backend, DevOps, and Leadership roles.
